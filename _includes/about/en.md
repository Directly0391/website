Hey, I’m Andre Woods. I am a full-time student pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Cybersecurity, with an expected graduation date in June 2026. While I am still early in my career, I have focused on building a solid technical foundation. This is demonstrated by my CCNA and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications.

My technical skills are put into practice daily through my work as an IT Support Intern at Aegis Living. In this role, I provide technical assistance and Tier 2 support to a large organization of over 2,000 employees. My responsibilities include managing and troubleshooting critical network infrastructure, such as Wi-Fi, LAN, and VPN access, as well as supporting cloud-based services and streamlining user on-boarding through device provisioning. I am especially passionate about securely applying AI to improve support workflows and strengthen overall system security.

Before transitioning into the IT field, I served as a school bus driver for the Issaquah School District. This unique background provided me with a proven track record of reliability, accountability, and the ability to remain calm under pressure in safety-critical environments. These "soft skills" are essential in cybersecurity, where attention to detail and a composed response to high-stakes incidents are vital to maintaining a secure environment.

To continuously sharpen my technical edge, I am an active participant in Hack The Box and various campus clubs. Engaging with these communities allows me to practice hands-on penetration testing and defensive strategies beyond the classroom. I am driven by a commitment to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape and to contribute to the security and efficiency of the organizations I serve.
